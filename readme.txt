Transform your login page with animated visual effects, dynamic backgrounds, glassmorphism, custom branding, and modern color controls.

== Description ==

**Loginflux** is a lightweight, modern plugin that transforms the default WordPress login page into a state-of-the-art visual experience.

Featuring built-in animated visual effects—including dynamic **Fluid Flow gradients**—and an ultra-sleek **Glassmorphism container**, you can effortlessly match the login experience with your brand identity directly from an intuitive, tabbed WordPress admin dashboard.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **8 Modern Animated Background Engines:** Choose between Animation 1 (Pulse Orb & Cyber Grid), Animation 2 (Nebula Glow & Noise), Animation 3 (Aurora Gradient Flow), Animation 4 (Ambient Mesh Spin), Animation 5 (Cosmic Starfield & Stardust), Animation 6 (Holographic Prism & Cyber Waves), Animation 7 (Retro Synthwave & Neon Horizon), and Animation 8 (Liquid Morphing Blobs) with full color and speed controls.
* **Smart Background Fallback:** Automatically switches between your uploaded custom background image and fluid animated visual gradients.
* **Form Controls & Element Visibility:** Toggle visibility of the "Lost your password?", "Back to website", "Remember me", and Language Switcher elements with modern switches.
* **Custom Input Placeholders:** Define custom placeholder hints for the Username and Password fields.
* **Custom Footer & Copyright Content:** Display custom copyright or privacy notice with safe HTML support below the form.
* **WordPress Media Library Integration:** Seamlessly upload or choose logos and background images using the native WordPress Media Uploader.
* **Ultra-Modern Glassmorphism UI:** Frosted glass effect with configurable backdrop blur, card background opacity, and border radius.
* **Branding & Logo Controls:** Customize your logo image, logo dimensions, and subtitle text.
* **Live Color Customizer:** Use the built-in WordPress Color Picker to customize primary button colors, hover states, text colors, and all animation palettes.
* **Clean & Lightweight:** Designed to keep the login screen fast and avoid unnecessary external JavaScript dependencies.
* **Translation Ready:** Fully internationalized and compatible with WordPress translation standards using the `loginflux` text domain.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do the animated background gradients work? =

When no background image is set, Loginflux renders a dynamic CSS animated gradient flow background using customizable color stops. You can adjust the gradient colors and animation speed from the Loginflux settings.

= Can I use my own background wallpaper instead? =

Yes! Upload or select a background image from the WordPress Media Library in the Background & Effects settings. When a background image is set, it takes priority over the animated gradient background.

= Does this plugin affect login security or authentication? =

No. Loginflux only customizes the visual presentation and styling of the WordPress login screen. It does not modify WordPress authentication, password validation, or login security functionality.

= Is it translation ready? =

Yes. Loginflux follows WordPress internationalization standards and uses the `loginflux` text domain.
